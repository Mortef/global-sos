## üö® IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER üö®

**This application is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind. It is intended as a helpful aid but is NOT a substitute for local knowledge or official emergency services.**

The country detection methods (GPS, network, IP address) are not 100% accurate and can fail under various conditions (e.g., airplane mode, no signal). **Always verify the displayed country and numbers if possible before calling.** The developers assume no liability for damages resulting from the use of this software.

---

## Key Features

* **Automatic Country Detection:** Uses the phone's GPS, cellular network, and IP address to determine your current country.
* **Manual Override:** If the detected country is wrong, you can easily select the correct one from a list.
* **One-Tap Calling:** Clearly displayed buttons for Police, Ambulance, and Fire services for the selected country.
* **Free & Open Source:** No ads, no tracking. The code is transparent.

## Getting Started
